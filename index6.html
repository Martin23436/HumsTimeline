    <h1 class="title">Who Were the US Freedom riders?</h1>
    <div class="white-format">
       <p>The freedom riders in the United States were groups of white and black civil right activists who traveled throughout the South of America protesting against the segregated areas such as the bus terminals. When traveling the riders did every little thing they could to protest against they were met with police officers who would then arrest them and would also meet angry mobs of people who would violently harass and assault the riders. The assaults werenâ€™t just everyday attacks, the riders were met with fatal violence against their protests. <br><br>

The protest did not succeed how it was meant to at the time but, as said before, it became a very significant stepping stone for the freedom and civil rights of African Americans in the United States. In the end, a majority of the freedom riders were arrested and thus did not change any laws or policies but they definitely did change the hearts of many people.
