    <div class="white-format">
       <p>The freedom riders in the United States were groups of white and black civil right activists who traveled throughout the South of America protesting against <span class="popup" onclick="myFunction()" ><strong>segregated areas (click me!)</strong> <span class="popuptext2" id="myPopup"> <img style="width: 140%; height: auto; border: 10px solid black; border-radius: 15px;" src="IMG/segregated.jpg" alt="An image of the segregated areas"></span> </span> (areas where the white and black couldn't be mixed in with each other) such as bus terminals and lunch areas. When traveling, the riders did every little thing they could to protest against these policies. They were met with police officers who would then arrest them and would also meet angry mobs of people who would violently harass and assault the riders. The assaults werenâ€™t just everyday attacks, the riders were met with fatal violence for their actions. <br><br>

The protest did not succeed how it was meant to at the time but, as said before, it became a very significant stepping stone for the freedom and civil rights of the African Americans in the United States. In the end, a majority of the freedom riders were arrested and thus did not change any laws or policies but they definitely did change the hearts of many.
