    <div class="white-format">
       <p>On the 26th of January, 1938, the first national Aboriginal civil rights movement was held, the Day of Mourning. 100 Aboriginal men, women and children all gathered in the Australian hall in Sydney. All protesting inside a hall which was a popular venue for dances, concerts and other social events. All the attendees were of Aboriginal heritage as it was asked from the organiser that only Aboriginal people were to attend. All the participants were from around Australia making this event even more significant than it already was. The reasoning behind the gathering was to raise awareness of the aboriginal people's difficult lifestyle towards non-indigenous Australians and to dismantle the <span class="popup" onclick="myFunction()" ><strong>Protections Boards (click me!)</strong> <span class="popuptext" id="myPopup" style="font-size: 24px; width: 130%;">The Aborigines Protection Board was established to manage reserves and the welfare of the estimated 9000 Aboriginal people living in New South Wales in the 1880s. It was part of the Department of Police and was chaired by the Commissioner of Police.</span> </span>.<br><br>

The major event was covered by the radio, press and the Prime Minister, at the time (Joseph Lyons), even agreed to receive a deputation of the delegates. Eventually from this movement, it led to a reforming of the Protection Board then in 1967 it led to a referendum which approved the counting of Aboriginal people in the national census. This particular referendum, 27th May 1967, was recorded as the largest ever ‘Yes’ vote in a referendum to alter the Australian constitution.
