    <h1 class="title">Who Were the ‘Little Rock Nine’?</h1>
    <div class="white-format">
       <p>On this significant day a courageous nine African American Students attended Central High School after the Supreme court decision in 1954 which would allow any people of colour to attend schools. The nine attended a school which was entirely made up of white coloured people thus why this attendance of the African American students was such a big event. Minnijean Brown Trickey (member of the nine, age 15) said that the decision to move to Central High School was because “The black school was kinda far away” and that it would be very exciting to meet new kids but later she would realise that that thinking was too naive of her. <br><br>

In the first term of schooling, the nine had been stopped by national guards from entering the school where there were 1900 white attendees at the school as it was for their safety. 3 weeks after, the nine took on courage and entered the school accompanied by US army troops. While entering the school, the nine were cursed at and harrassed even when the army troops accompanied them. <br><br>

This courage by the nine would then soon become one of the stepping stones of the civil rights and freedom movement for the Afirican Americans of the United States. Not only was this a significant movement by itself but the movement would have had to also have been inspired by the courage of Rosa Parks in 1957. Without the incidents of Rosa Parks and many others, I doubt the nine would have worked up the strength to go to a white school.
