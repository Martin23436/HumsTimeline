    <h1 class="title">Who Were the Aboriginal Freedom Riders? </h1>
    <div class="white-format">
       <p>Just like all the other protests and movements mentioned above, the freedom riders were very similar in what they wanted to achieve, to end disrcimination and injustice to Aboriginals of Australia. With the inspiration from the freedom riders in the US, a group of students from the University of Sydney traveled together across NSW touring through towns trying to put their name, SAFA (Student Action for Aborigines), out all around the country. <br><br>

The end goal which was to get people to recognize the discrimination and poor treatment of Aboriginals was shown to be successful in the end as their protest helped influence the dominated win on the 1967 Aboriginalâ€™s rights referendum. <br><br>

This particular event displays how much of an influence the freedom riders in the United States had as technology at the time was not so advanced that communication could be so easy with a country so far away.
