    <h1 class="title">What Was Martin Luther King's Speech About?, "I have a dream" </h1>
    <div class="white-format">
       <p>Martin Luther King was an African American civil rights activist and a Baptist minister. On this day he gave one of the most important and influential speech to all the African Americans across the US. As King drove home his speech with, “I have a dream”, this left many to believe that rights and freedoms for the African Americans is and will be possible. <br><br>

The speech was held at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC where 250,000 people had gathered there on a one-day marching protest against racial discrimination and to encourage the Civil Rights Act. The march included various speeches and musical performances before King’s speech. After King’s speech his name spread all around the country which then made the passing of the Civil Rights Act move even quicker. A year after the speech (1964) the Act was passed and many African Americans were finally experiencing the freedoms and equal treatment they deserved. <br><br>

This event could be argued to be the most significant and the final push towards African American rights. The confidence and bravery shown by the protestors on this day just shows the amount of effort and blood past activists had to put in for this inspirational movement to occur.
