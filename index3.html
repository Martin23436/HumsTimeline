       <p>In 1945 the establishment of the United Nation was made after the distressing and traumatic events during the second world war. 75 million total deaths which 17 million of those deaths were taken during the Holocaust. As the world did not want to experience something as terrible as this again and wanted to create an international peace, countries all over the world gathered their minds together and in the end resulted with the United Nations. <br><br>

Approximately 3 years later, representatives of the 50 member states of the United Nations all gathered together under Eleanor Rooseveltâ€™s (American political figure) guidance to find and create a list of human rights. As a result, the group created a <span class="popup" onclick="myFunction()" ><strong>list of 30 rights and freedoms (click me!) </strong> <span class="popuptext" id="myPopup"><a style="color: white; text-decoration: none; font-size: 24px;"href="https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/commission-general/universal-declaration-human-rights-human-rights-your-fingertips-human"> Find out what the 30 rights and freedoms were (click me again!)</a></span> </span> whom belonged to everyone.
