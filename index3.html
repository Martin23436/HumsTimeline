    <h1 class="title">What was the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?</h1>
    <div class="white-format">
       <p>In 1945 the establishment of the United Nation was made after the distressing and traumatic events during the second world war. 75 million total deaths and 17 million of those were taken during the Holocaust. As the world did not want to experience something as terrible as this again and wanted to create and international peace, countries all over the world gathered their minds together and in the end resulted with the United Nations. <br><br>

Approximately 3 years later, representatives of the 50 member states of the United Nations all gathered together under Eleanor Rooseveltâ€™s (American political figure) guidance to find and create a list of human rights which everyone around the globe should have. As a result, the group created a list of 30 rights and freedoms which belongs to everyone internationally.
