    <h1 class="title">What Was the Poor People’s Campaign About?</h1>
    <div class="white-format">
       <p>Organised by Martin Luther King, the goals of the poors people’s campaign was to fix the lack of extreme financial freedom people in America had. This campaign was a campaign that included all races, not just the Afican American community or any other specific community. A committee of 100 people was formed to fight against the government about their economic bills. <br><br>

The campaign was successful in the fact that there were small changes that would help people’s financial situation but the overall top goal of the group was not achieved as the economic bill of rights was never passed. <br><br>

The poor people’s campaign was set to continue even after the failed bill, however before things could be prepared and continued, Martin Luther King was assassinated thus leading to a sudden wall for the campaign to break through. In the end the campaign was more recognized for its multi-coloured collaboration than it was for the financial freedom.
