    <h1 class="title">What happened During the Cummeragunja Walk Off?</h1>
    <div class="white-format">
       <p>On this day, an estimated 200 residents protested to the government about their horrible treatment and living conditions by walking out of the Cummeragunja Station on strike.  The people who left on strike moved across the river into Victoria which they then settled into places such as Barmah, Echuca, Mooroopna and further down into the city. The strike lasted for 9 months before the mission manager was eventually transferred. Only a handful of people returned back to the station, the rest preferred to stay where they were in Victoria. <br><br>

The Cummerganja Walk (in my opinion), which was described as the first ever major effecting mass strike by the Aboriginal people, would have definitely been inspired by the Day of Mourning protests in Sydney. This movement would have also contributed to the 1967 referendum to allow rights for the Aboriginals of Australia.
