       <p>During this day, a certain courageous tired black woman finally stood up for herself against the dominating white race by refusing to give up her front seat to a white man. Her action would then lead to her arrest and a fine as any African American who disobeyed the stateâ€™s transport segregation policies were to be arrested and fined. <br><br>

And with this arrest multiple African American figures were outraged which then led to a protest against this segregation policy. The organizers of these protests were Martin Luther King, Ralph David Abernathy, Edgar Nixon and Bayard Rustin. The final decision of the protest was persuaded by JoAnn Robinson, the idea was to launch a bus boycott. In this boycott the African American people of Montgomery were to refuse any use of buses which meant that they would walk or take lifts from other African Americans. This was to continue until there was a change to the policy. This led on for another 13 months until eventually the loss of revenue was too much and a decision by the Supreme court forced the Montgomery bus company to accept the integration of both colours.
